===============================================================================
| This directory is the root from the directory structure of the framework.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
| In this directory is only the Qt project file of the RedScarf framework
| (RedScarf.pro) and the project resources directory.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
| Open RedScarf.pro file in Qt Creator IDE.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
| For more information find Readme files in subdirectories.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
| IMPORTANT:
| 1-) If you want to version the code, please keep concise the directory
| structure (each file in correct place), for instance, DON'T put source-code in
| documentation directory, unless it is very, but very important for the
| documentation.
|
| 2-) Don't add irrelevant files to version control, as files for compilation
| and correct run of the framework (i.e.: object files - ".o",
| libraries [DLLs | SOs | DYLIBs], etc). Use ".gitignore" file.
|
| 3-) Update the "Readme" files and create them when a new directory is
| necessary. Use the header to inform the details as the modification/creation
| date, the responsible by change, details and increment the revision.
| NOTE: Version.Subversion.Revision. The version corresponds to the version of
| tool. The subversion corresponds to significant changes as critical fixes or
| new features IN THE TOOL!
| And the revision corresponds to changes that they were not supervisioned by
| manager of the project, as bugs fixes or little adjusts that were not
| incorporated to the tool.
|
| Each source-code file also contains a header to comment the revisions.
| In the subdirectory "dist" use the files: ChangeLog and NEWS to detail the
| changes.
