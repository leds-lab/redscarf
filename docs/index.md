## Welcome to RedScarf project
RedScarf (as an simulation environment) is an open-source project started to facilitate and to encourage students and researchers contribute to advance of Network-on-Chip discoveries.
It is composed by a front-end and back-end (therefore simulation environment).

The front-end is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to setup network-on-chip topologies, router architectures and traffic scenarios.
Besides, the front-end is capable of run simulations and generate reports and graphs based on automatic analysis performed by tools self-contained.

The back-end is the simulator itself and agregates a set of architectural Network-on-Chip models (i.e. topologies, routing algorithms, flow controls, arbiter policies, and buffering strategies).
